		<p style = "font-size: 120%;"> Tensions are at an all-time high after the arrest of the former bounty hunter, Heydrich Kralick. The man responsible for his capture, Ryan Singleton, has continued to hone his skills after the demise of the infamous alien. But now, Ryanâ€™s closest ally and mentor, Katie Anderson, seeks another life. Once the best bounty hunter of her group, only behind her boss Jody Winters, she leaves her former team behind in order to follow in the footsteps of her legendary parents, the Anderson Duo. Though deceased, she still holds them in high regard. However, she still lacks the skill to carry the burden of their legacy. She seeks aid from a mysterious alien, Neyvis Dunnwalker. Upon their meeting, his intentions seem good, at first. However, he quickly leads her down a path of death and destruction, and eventually, against her old team. With Katie caught in the middle of two powerful factions, her action-packed journey is one that could lead to a bloody war between the humans and aliens.

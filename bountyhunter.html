		<p style = "font-size: 120%;">Ryan Singleton is sick of home—sick of his dad ragging on him and the dullness of closing his eyes at the end of the day, knowing he’s going to open them the next to the same monotonous thing. So he leaves home to become a bounty hunter. But that kind of life doesn’t come easy.
		He tears through one of the biggest zero gravity races in the area to secure the money he needs to start his future, and then nearly winds up dead on his first bounty. Luckily for him, a mysterious woman named Jody, an elite bounty hunter herself, comes to his rescue and dangles the future he dreams of right in front of him. All that stands in his way is Heydrich Kralick—a rival alien bounty hunter who hates him for besting him in that race. He’s ruthless, wanted by the law, and obsessed. Ryan stands to gain prestige, money, a world of passion and adventure.
		All he stands to lose is his life.

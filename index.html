		<p style = "font-size: 120%;">For six years, Scott Rogers and Alyx Hutchens served as capable, loyal soldiers of the Astral Empire. But in the midst of a seemingly pointless war, these close friends began to question their part in the army and their role in the killing of innocent civilians.

		   After defying direct orders to kill a helpless civilian, General Orell declares both men treasonous and orders their fellow soldiers to kill them. Scott and Alex narrowly escape and become fugitives. But instead of hiding away, the men travel the world in an effort to gain enough support to challenge the country they fled in hopes of a better future.

		   Against insurmountable odds and despite great danger, Scott and Alyx work together as a formidable duo to fight for their convictions.
